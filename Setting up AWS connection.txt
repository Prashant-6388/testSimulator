Creating AWS account to setup s3 and ec2 services

Create a AWS accout(just google it for process)

go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam
create user group
in user group configure below permissions
	-AmazonEC2FullAccess
	-AmazonS3FullAccess
Create a user and assign it to user group created previously.

install AWS client:
for windows use MSI installer using below link
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html#install-msi-on-windows
	
to test if installation is successful or not run below commond from CMD
aws --vesion

you should be able to see to see two files 
	-config
	-credentials

to create a profile use command 
aws configure --profile <profile name>

it will ask for aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key, region and output
you can get this information for IAM console 
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/
click on user you have created previously, go to security credentials tab
you can see both keys and region at last in Last Used column something like 2019-01-01 13:35 UTC+0530 with s3 in us-east-1(region is us-east-1)
for output you can specify json(default output format)

now you have to create Bucket in S3, use https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
create a bucket(just follow on screen instructions)

now use command 
aws s3 ls --profile <your profile name>
this will list buckets available for your profile and you should be able to see bucket you have created in above step in your cmd prompt
----troubleshooting--------------
if you face any issue in listing s3 you might need to check details entered druing profile creation
you can verify region in ~/.aws/config file and for signatrue issue you need to check in ~/.aws/credentials file
